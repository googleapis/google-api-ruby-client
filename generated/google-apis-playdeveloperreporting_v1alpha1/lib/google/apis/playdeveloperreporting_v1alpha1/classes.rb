        # how events are aggregated in metrics. The points in a timeline are defined by
        # the starting DateTime of the aggregation period. The duration is implicit in
        # the AggregationPeriod. Hourly aggregation periods, when supported by a metric
        # set, are always specified in UTC to avoid ambiguities around daylight saving
        # time transitions, where an hour is skipped when adopting DST, and repeated
        # when abandoning DST. For example, the timestamp '2021-11-07 01:00:00 America/
        # Los_Angeles' is ambiguous since it can correspond to '2021-11-07 08:00:00 UTC'
        # or '2021-11-07 09:00:00 UTC'. Daily aggregation periods require specifying a

      # process state data to produce a normalized metric independent of user counts. *
      # *Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are aggregated in calendar
      # date intervals. Due to historical constraints, the only supported timezone is `
      # America/Los_Angeles`. **Supported metrics:** * `stuckBgWakelockRate` (`google.
      # type.Decimal`): Percentage of distinct users in the aggregation period that
      # had a wakelock held in the background for longer than 1 hour. * `
      # stuckBgWakelockRate7dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average
      # value of `stuckBgWakelockRate` in the last 7 days. The daily values are
      # weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `
      # stuckBgWakelockRate28dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average
      # value of `stuckBgWakelockRate` in the last 28 days. The daily values are
      # weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `distinctUsers` (`
      # google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users in the aggregation period that
      # were used as normalization value for the `stuckBgWakelockRate` metric. A user
      # is counted in this metric if their app was doing any work on the device, i.e.,
      # not just active foreground usage but also background work. Care must be taken
      # not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted
      # multiple times. The value is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10, 100, 1,000
      # or 1,000,000, depending on the magnitude of the value. **Supported dimensions:*
      # * * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running on the user'
      # s device, e.g., 26. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was
      # running on the user's device. * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of
      # the user's device model. The form of the identifier is 'deviceBrand/device',
      # where deviceBrand corresponds to Build.BRAND and device corresponds to Build.
      # DEVICE, e.g., google/coral. * `deviceBrand` (string): unique identifier of the
      # user's device brand, e.g., google. * `deviceType` (string): the type (also
      # known as form factor) of the user's device, e.g., PHONE. * `countryCode` (
      # string): the country or region of the user's device based on their IP address,
      # represented as a 2-letter ISO-3166 code (e.g. US for the United States). * `
      # deviceRamBucket` (int64): RAM of the device, in MB, in buckets (3GB, 4GB, etc.)

      # , Samsung. [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/

      # Specification of the time-related aggregation parameters of a timeline.
      # Timelines have an aggregation period (`DAILY`, `HOURLY`, etc) which defines
      # how events are aggregated in metrics. The points in a timeline are defined by
      # the starting DateTime of the aggregation period. The duration is implicit in
      # the AggregationPeriod. Hourly aggregation periods, when supported by a metric
      # set, are always specified in UTC to avoid ambiguities around daylight saving
      # time transitions, where an hour is skipped when adopting DST, and repeated
      # when abandoning DST. For example, the timestamp '2021-11-07 01:00:00 America/
      # Los_Angeles' is ambiguous since it can correspond to '2021-11-07 08:00:00 UTC'
      # or '2021-11-07 09:00:00 UTC'. Daily aggregation periods require specifying a
      # timezone which will determine the precise instants of the start and the end of
      # the day. Not all metric sets support all timezones, so make sure to check
