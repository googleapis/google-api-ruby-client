        # how events are aggregated in metrics. The points in a timeline are defined by
        # the starting DateTime of the aggregation period. The duration is implicit in
        # the AggregationPeriod. Hourly aggregation periods, when supported by a metric
        # set, are always specified in UTC to avoid ambiguities around daylight saving
        # time transitions, where an hour is skipped when adopting DST, and repeated
        # when abandoning DST. For example, the timestamp '2021-11-07 01:00:00 America/
        # Los_Angeles' is ambiguous since it can correspond to '2021-11-07 08:00:00 UTC'
        # or '2021-11-07 09:00:00 UTC'. Daily aggregation periods require specifying a
        # timezone which will determine the precise instants of the start and the end of
        # the day. Not all metric sets support all timezones, so make sure to check

      # Specification of the time-related aggregation parameters of a timeline.
      # Timelines have an aggregation period (`DAILY`, `HOURLY`, etc) which defines
      # how events are aggregated in metrics. The points in a timeline are defined by
      # the starting DateTime of the aggregation period. The duration is implicit in
      # the AggregationPeriod. Hourly aggregation periods, when supported by a metric
      # set, are always specified in UTC to avoid ambiguities around daylight saving
      # time transitions, where an hour is skipped when adopting DST, and repeated
      # when abandoning DST. For example, the timestamp '2021-11-07 01:00:00 America/
      # Los_Angeles' is ambiguous since it can correspond to '2021-11-07 08:00:00 UTC'
      # or '2021-11-07 09:00:00 UTC'. Daily aggregation periods require specifying a
      # timezone which will determine the precise instants of the start and the end of
      # the day. Not all metric sets support all timezones, so make sure to check
