        # controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`.
        # A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`.
        # Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (
        # such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be
        # an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
        # Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a
        # logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
        # evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
        # the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
        # conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.
        # google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ` "

      # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`.
      # A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`.
      # Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (
      # such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be
      # an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
      # Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a
      # logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
      # evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
      # the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
      # conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.
      # google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ` "
      # bindings": [ ` "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
      # "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "
