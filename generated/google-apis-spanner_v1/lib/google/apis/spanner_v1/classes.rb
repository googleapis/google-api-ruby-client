        # completed, the session can immediately be re-used for the next transaction. It
        # is not necessary to create a new session for each transaction. Transaction
        # modes: Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes: 1. Locking read-write.
        # This type of transaction is the only way to write data into Cloud Spanner.
        # These transactions rely on pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase
        # commit. Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the application
        # to retry. 2. Snapshot read-only. Snapshot read-only transactions provide
        # guaranteed consistency across several reads, but do not allow writes. Snapshot
        # read-only transactions can be configured to read at timestamps in the past, or
        # configured to perform a strong read (where Spanner will select a timestamp
        # such that the read is guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions that
        # have committed before the start of the read). Snapshot read-only transactions
        # do not need to be committed. Queries on change streams must be performed with
        # the snapshot read-only transaction mode, specifying a strong read. See
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong for more details. 3. Partitioned DML. This
        # type of transaction is used to execute a single Partitioned DML statement.
        # Partitioned DML partitions the key space and runs the DML statement over each
        # partition in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
        # independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be committed. For
        # transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions provide simpler
        # semantics and are almost always faster. In particular, read-only transactions
        # do not take locks, so they do not conflict with read-write transactions. As a
        # consequence of not taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are
        # not needed. Transactions may only read-write data in a single database. They
        # may, however, read-write data in different tables within that database.
        # Locking read-write transactions: Locking transactions may be used to
        # atomically read-modify-write data anywhere in a database. This type of
        # transaction is externally consistent. Clients should attempt to minimize the
        # amount of time a transaction is active. Faster transactions commit with higher
        # probability and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read
        # locks active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
        # transaction has not been terminated by Commit or Rollback. Long periods of
        # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a transaction's
        # locks and abort it. Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or
        # more reads or SQL statements followed by Commit. At any time before Commit,
        # the client can send a Rollback request to abort the transaction. Semantics:
        # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired are
        # still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write locks for all
        # writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any reason. If a commit
        # attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees that the transaction has
        # not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner. Unless the transaction commits,
        # Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about how long the transaction's locks were
        # held for. It is an error to use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual
        # exclusion other than between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves. Retrying
        # aborted transactions: When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to
        # retry the whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
        # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the same session
        # as the original attempt. The original session's lock priority increases with
        # each consecutive abort, meaning that each attempt has a slightly better chance
        # of success than the previous. Note that the lock priority is preserved per
        # session (not per transaction). Lock priority is set by the first read or write
        # in the first attempt of a read-write transaction. If the application starts a
        # new session to retry the whole transaction, the transaction loses its original
        # lock priority. Moreover, the lock priority is only preserved if the
        # transaction fails with an `ABORTED` error. Under some circumstances (for
        # example, many transactions attempting to modify the same row(s)), a
        # transaction can abort many times in a short period before successfully
        # committing. Thus, it is not a good idea to cap the number of retries a
        # transaction can attempt; instead, it is better to limit the total amount of
        # time spent retrying. Idle transactions: A transaction is considered idle if it
        # has no outstanding reads or SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL
        # query within the last 10 seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud
        # Spanner so that they don't hold on to locks indefinitely. If an idle
        # transaction is aborted, the commit will fail with error `ABORTED`. If this
        # behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple SQL query in the
        # transaction (for example, `SELECT 1`) prevents the transaction from becoming
        # idle. Snapshot read-only transactions: Snapshot read-only transactions
        # provides a simpler method than locking read-write transactions for doing
        # several consistent reads. However, this type of transaction does not support
        # writes. Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
        # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that timestamp.
        # Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block concurrent read-write
        # transactions. Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
        # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read timestamp is
        # garbage collected; however, the default garbage collection policy is generous
        # enough that most applications do not need to worry about this in practice.
        # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call Commit or Rollback (and in
        # fact are not permitted to do so). To execute a snapshot transaction, the
        # client specifies a timestamp bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a
        # read timestamp. The types of timestamp bound are: - Strong (the default). -
        # Bounded staleness. - Exact staleness. If the Cloud Spanner database to be read
        # is geographically distributed, stale read-only transactions can execute more
        # quickly than strong or read-write transactions, because they are able to
        # execute far from the leader replica. Each type of timestamp bound is discussed
        # in detail below. Strong: Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all
        # transactions that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore,
        # all rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if any
        # part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
        # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are concurrent writes.
        # If consistency across reads is required, the reads should be executed within a
        # transaction or at an exact read timestamp. Queries on change streams (see
        # below for more details) must also specify the strong read timestamp bound. See
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong. Exact staleness: These timestamp bounds
        # execute reads at a user-specified timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are
        # guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of the global transaction history: they
        # observe modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp less
        # than or equal to the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications
        # done by transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until all
        # conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps <= the read
        # timestamp have finished. The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute
        # Cloud Spanner commit timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a timestamp. As a
        # result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent boundedly stale
        # concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads usually return
        # fresher results. See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness. Bounded staleness: Bounded
        # staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to a
        # user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp
        # within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest
        # available replica without blocking. All rows yielded are consistent with each
        # other -- if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale reads,
        # even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at different
        # timestamps and thus return inconsistent results. Boundedly stale reads execute
        # in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among all replicas
        # needed to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the
        # negotiated timestamp. As a result of the two phase execution, bounded
        # staleness reads are usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher results, and are
        # more likely to execute at the closest replica. Because the timestamp
        # negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which rows will be read, it can
        # only be used with single-use read-only transactions. See TransactionOptions.
        # ReadOnly.max_staleness and TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp. Old
        # read timestamps and garbage collection: Cloud Spanner continuously garbage
        # collects deleted and overwritten data in the background to reclaim storage
        # space. This process is known as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims
        # versions after they are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot
        # perform reads at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
        # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
        # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with too-old
        # read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. You can configure
        # and extend the `VERSION_RETENTION_PERIOD` of a database up to a period as long
        # as one week, which allows Cloud Spanner to perform reads up to one week in the
        # past. Querying change Streams: A Change Stream is a schema object that can be
        # configured to watch data changes on the entire database, a set of tables, or a
        # set of columns in a database. When a change stream is created, Spanner
        # automatically defines a corresponding SQL Table-Valued Function (TVF) that can
        # be used to query the change records in the associated change stream using the
        # ExecuteStreamingSql API. The name of the TVF for a change stream is generated
        # from the name of the change stream: READ_. All queries on change stream TVFs
        # must be executed using the ExecuteStreamingSql API with a single-use read-only
        # transaction with a strong read-only timestamp_bound. The change stream TVF
        # allows users to specify the start_timestamp and end_timestamp for the time
        # range of interest. All change records within the retention period is
        # accessible using the strong read-only timestamp_bound. All other
        # TransactionOptions are invalid for change stream queries. In addition, if
        # TransactionOptions.read_only.return_read_timestamp is set to true, a special
        # value of 2^63 - 2 will be returned in the Transaction message that describes
        # the transaction, instead of a valid read timestamp. This special value should
        # be discarded and not used for any subsequent queries. Please see https://cloud.
        # google.com/spanner/docs/change-streams for more details on how to query the
        # change stream TVFs. Partitioned DML transactions: Partitioned DML transactions
        # are used to execute DML statements with a different execution strategy that
        # provides different, and often better, scalability properties for large, table-
        # wide operations than DML in a ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements,
        # such as an OLTP workload, should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
        # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
        # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
        # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another. To reduce
        # lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks on rows that
        # match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the smaller per-
        # partition transactions hold locks for less time. That said, Partitioned DML is
        # not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used in ReadWrite transactions. -
        # The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
        # must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only a
        # single row of the table. - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows
        # of the table. Rather, the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the
        # table, in independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated
        # atomically with the base table rows. - Partitioned DML does not guarantee
        # exactly-once execution semantics against a partition. The statement is applied
        # at least once to each partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML
        # statement should be idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it
        # is potentially dangerous to run a statement such as `UPDATE table SET column =

        # modes: Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes: 1. Locking read-write.
        # This type of transaction is the only way to write data into Cloud Spanner.
        # These transactions rely on pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase
        # commit. Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the application
        # to retry. 2. Snapshot read-only. Snapshot read-only transactions provide
        # guaranteed consistency across several reads, but do not allow writes. Snapshot
        # read-only transactions can be configured to read at timestamps in the past, or
        # configured to perform a strong read (where Spanner will select a timestamp
        # such that the read is guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions that
        # have committed before the start of the read). Snapshot read-only transactions
        # do not need to be committed. Queries on change streams must be performed with
        # the snapshot read-only transaction mode, specifying a strong read. See
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong for more details. 3. Partitioned DML. This
        # type of transaction is used to execute a single Partitioned DML statement.
        # Partitioned DML partitions the key space and runs the DML statement over each
        # partition in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
        # independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be committed. For
        # transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions provide simpler
        # semantics and are almost always faster. In particular, read-only transactions
        # do not take locks, so they do not conflict with read-write transactions. As a
        # consequence of not taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are
        # not needed. Transactions may only read-write data in a single database. They
        # may, however, read-write data in different tables within that database.
        # Locking read-write transactions: Locking transactions may be used to
        # atomically read-modify-write data anywhere in a database. This type of
        # transaction is externally consistent. Clients should attempt to minimize the
        # amount of time a transaction is active. Faster transactions commit with higher
        # probability and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read
        # locks active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
        # transaction has not been terminated by Commit or Rollback. Long periods of
        # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a transaction's
        # locks and abort it. Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or
        # more reads or SQL statements followed by Commit. At any time before Commit,
        # the client can send a Rollback request to abort the transaction. Semantics:
        # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired are
        # still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write locks for all
        # writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any reason. If a commit
        # attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees that the transaction has
        # not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner. Unless the transaction commits,
        # Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about how long the transaction's locks were
        # held for. It is an error to use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual
        # exclusion other than between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves. Retrying
        # aborted transactions: When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to
        # retry the whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
        # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the same session
        # as the original attempt. The original session's lock priority increases with
        # each consecutive abort, meaning that each attempt has a slightly better chance
        # of success than the previous. Note that the lock priority is preserved per
        # session (not per transaction). Lock priority is set by the first read or write
        # in the first attempt of a read-write transaction. If the application starts a
        # new session to retry the whole transaction, the transaction loses its original
        # lock priority. Moreover, the lock priority is only preserved if the
        # transaction fails with an `ABORTED` error. Under some circumstances (for
        # example, many transactions attempting to modify the same row(s)), a
        # transaction can abort many times in a short period before successfully
        # committing. Thus, it is not a good idea to cap the number of retries a
        # transaction can attempt; instead, it is better to limit the total amount of
        # time spent retrying. Idle transactions: A transaction is considered idle if it
        # has no outstanding reads or SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL
        # query within the last 10 seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud
        # Spanner so that they don't hold on to locks indefinitely. If an idle
        # transaction is aborted, the commit will fail with error `ABORTED`. If this
        # behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple SQL query in the
        # transaction (for example, `SELECT 1`) prevents the transaction from becoming
        # idle. Snapshot read-only transactions: Snapshot read-only transactions
        # provides a simpler method than locking read-write transactions for doing
        # several consistent reads. However, this type of transaction does not support
        # writes. Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
        # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that timestamp.
        # Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block concurrent read-write
        # transactions. Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
        # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read timestamp is
        # garbage collected; however, the default garbage collection policy is generous
        # enough that most applications do not need to worry about this in practice.
        # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call Commit or Rollback (and in
        # fact are not permitted to do so). To execute a snapshot transaction, the
        # client specifies a timestamp bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a
        # read timestamp. The types of timestamp bound are: - Strong (the default). -
        # Bounded staleness. - Exact staleness. If the Cloud Spanner database to be read
        # is geographically distributed, stale read-only transactions can execute more
        # quickly than strong or read-write transactions, because they are able to
        # execute far from the leader replica. Each type of timestamp bound is discussed
        # in detail below. Strong: Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all
        # transactions that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore,
        # all rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if any
        # part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
        # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are concurrent writes.
        # If consistency across reads is required, the reads should be executed within a
        # transaction or at an exact read timestamp. Queries on change streams (see
        # below for more details) must also specify the strong read timestamp bound. See
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong. Exact staleness: These timestamp bounds
        # execute reads at a user-specified timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are
        # guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of the global transaction history: they
        # observe modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp less
        # than or equal to the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications
        # done by transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until all
        # conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps <= the read
        # timestamp have finished. The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute
        # Cloud Spanner commit timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a timestamp. As a
        # result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent boundedly stale
        # concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads usually return
        # fresher results. See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness. Bounded staleness: Bounded
        # staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to a
        # user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp
        # within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest
        # available replica without blocking. All rows yielded are consistent with each
        # other -- if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale reads,
        # even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at different
        # timestamps and thus return inconsistent results. Boundedly stale reads execute
        # in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among all replicas
        # needed to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the
        # negotiated timestamp. As a result of the two phase execution, bounded
        # staleness reads are usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher results, and are
        # more likely to execute at the closest replica. Because the timestamp
        # negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which rows will be read, it can
        # only be used with single-use read-only transactions. See TransactionOptions.
        # ReadOnly.max_staleness and TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp. Old
        # read timestamps and garbage collection: Cloud Spanner continuously garbage
        # collects deleted and overwritten data in the background to reclaim storage
        # space. This process is known as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims
        # versions after they are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot
        # perform reads at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
        # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
        # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with too-old
        # read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. You can configure
        # and extend the `VERSION_RETENTION_PERIOD` of a database up to a period as long
        # as one week, which allows Cloud Spanner to perform reads up to one week in the
        # past. Querying change Streams: A Change Stream is a schema object that can be
        # configured to watch data changes on the entire database, a set of tables, or a
        # set of columns in a database. When a change stream is created, Spanner
        # automatically defines a corresponding SQL Table-Valued Function (TVF) that can
        # be used to query the change records in the associated change stream using the
        # ExecuteStreamingSql API. The name of the TVF for a change stream is generated
        # from the name of the change stream: READ_. All queries on change stream TVFs
        # must be executed using the ExecuteStreamingSql API with a single-use read-only
        # transaction with a strong read-only timestamp_bound. The change stream TVF
        # allows users to specify the start_timestamp and end_timestamp for the time
        # range of interest. All change records within the retention period is
        # accessible using the strong read-only timestamp_bound. All other
        # TransactionOptions are invalid for change stream queries. In addition, if
        # TransactionOptions.read_only.return_read_timestamp is set to true, a special
        # value of 2^63 - 2 will be returned in the Transaction message that describes
        # the transaction, instead of a valid read timestamp. This special value should
        # be discarded and not used for any subsequent queries. Please see https://cloud.
        # google.com/spanner/docs/change-streams for more details on how to query the
        # change stream TVFs. Partitioned DML transactions: Partitioned DML transactions
        # are used to execute DML statements with a different execution strategy that
        # provides different, and often better, scalability properties for large, table-
        # wide operations than DML in a ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements,
        # such as an OLTP workload, should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
        # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
        # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
        # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another. To reduce
        # lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks on rows that
        # match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the smaller per-
        # partition transactions hold locks for less time. That said, Partitioned DML is
        # not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used in ReadWrite transactions. -
        # The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
        # must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only a
        # single row of the table. - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows
        # of the table. Rather, the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the
        # table, in independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated
        # atomically with the base table rows. - Partitioned DML does not guarantee
        # exactly-once execution semantics against a partition. The statement is applied
        # at least once to each partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML
        # statement should be idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it
        # is potentially dangerous to run a statement such as `UPDATE table SET column =
        # column + 1` as it could be run multiple times against some rows. - The
        # partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for Commit or
        # Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing the
        # ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement executed
        # on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was never executed
        # against other rows. - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the
        # execution of a single DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql. -
        # If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
        # operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
        # value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the operation is
        # stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is possible that at this
        # point, some partitions have been committed (or even committed multiple times),
        # and other partitions have not been run at all. Given the above, Partitioned
        # DML is good fit for large, database-wide, operations that are idempotent, such
        # as deleting old rows from a very large table.

      # KeyRange represents a range of rows in a table or index. A range has a start
      # key and an end key. These keys can be open or closed, indicating if the range
      # includes rows with that key. Keys are represented by lists, where the ith
      # value in the list corresponds to the ith component of the table or index
      # primary key. Individual values are encoded as described here. For example,
      # consider the following table definition: CREATE TABLE UserEvents ( UserName
      # STRING(MAX), EventDate STRING(10) ) PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate); The
      # following keys name rows in this table: "Bob", "2014-09-23" Since the `
      # UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY KEY` clause names two columns, each `UserEvents`
      # key has two elements; the first is the `UserName`, and the second is the `
      # EventDate`. Key ranges with multiple components are interpreted
      # lexicographically by component using the table or index key's declared sort
      # order. For example, the following range returns all events for user `"Bob"`
      # that occurred in the year 2015: "start_closed": ["Bob", "2015-01-01"] "
      # end_closed": ["Bob", "2015-12-31"] Start and end keys can omit trailing key
      # components. This affects the inclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly
      # match the provided key components: if the key is closed, then rows that
      # exactly match the provided components are included; if the key is open, then
      # rows that exactly match are not included. For example, the following range
      # includes all events for `"Bob"` that occurred during and after the year 2000: "
      # start_closed": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"] "end_closed": ["Bob"] The next example
      # retrieves all events for `"Bob"`: "start_closed": ["Bob"] "end_closed": ["Bob"]
      # To retrieve events before the year 2000: "start_closed": ["Bob"] "end_open": [
      # "Bob", "2000-01-01"] The following range includes all rows in the table: "
      # start_closed": [] "end_closed": [] This range returns all users whose `
      # UserName` begins with any character from A to C: "start_closed": ["A"] "
      # end_open": ["D"] This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with B: "
      # start_closed": ["B"] "end_open": ["C"] Key ranges honor column sort order. For
      # example, suppose a table is defined as follows: CREATE TABLE
      # DescendingSortedTable ` Key INT64, ... ) PRIMARY KEY(Key DESC); The following
      # range retrieves all rows with key values between 1 and 100 inclusive: "
      # start_closed": ["100"] "end_closed": ["1"] Note that 100 is passed as the

      # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`.
      # A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`.
      # Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (
      # such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be
      # an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
      # Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a
      # logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
      # evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
      # the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
      # conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.
      # google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` ` "
      # bindings": [ ` "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
      # "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "
      # serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] `, ` "role": "
      # roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com"

      # 00:00.000Z')", ` ` ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 ` ``` **YAML
      # example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@

      # Transactions: Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time (
      # note that standalone reads and queries use a transaction internally and do
      # count towards the one transaction limit). After the active transaction is
      # completed, the session can immediately be re-used for the next transaction. It
      # is not necessary to create a new session for each transaction. Transaction
      # modes: Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes: 1. Locking read-write.
      # This type of transaction is the only way to write data into Cloud Spanner.
      # These transactions rely on pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase
      # commit. Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the application
      # to retry. 2. Snapshot read-only. Snapshot read-only transactions provide
      # guaranteed consistency across several reads, but do not allow writes. Snapshot
      # read-only transactions can be configured to read at timestamps in the past, or
      # configured to perform a strong read (where Spanner will select a timestamp
      # such that the read is guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions that
      # have committed before the start of the read). Snapshot read-only transactions
      # do not need to be committed. Queries on change streams must be performed with
      # the snapshot read-only transaction mode, specifying a strong read. See
      # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong for more details. 3. Partitioned DML. This
      # type of transaction is used to execute a single Partitioned DML statement.
      # Partitioned DML partitions the key space and runs the DML statement over each
      # partition in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
      # independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be committed. For
      # transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions provide simpler
      # semantics and are almost always faster. In particular, read-only transactions
      # do not take locks, so they do not conflict with read-write transactions. As a
      # consequence of not taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are
      # not needed. Transactions may only read-write data in a single database. They
      # may, however, read-write data in different tables within that database.
      # Locking read-write transactions: Locking transactions may be used to
      # atomically read-modify-write data anywhere in a database. This type of
      # transaction is externally consistent. Clients should attempt to minimize the
      # amount of time a transaction is active. Faster transactions commit with higher
      # probability and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read
      # locks active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
      # transaction has not been terminated by Commit or Rollback. Long periods of
      # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a transaction's
      # locks and abort it. Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or
      # more reads or SQL statements followed by Commit. At any time before Commit,
      # the client can send a Rollback request to abort the transaction. Semantics:
      # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired are
      # still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write locks for all
      # writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any reason. If a commit
      # attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees that the transaction has
      # not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner. Unless the transaction commits,
      # Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about how long the transaction's locks were
      # held for. It is an error to use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual
      # exclusion other than between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves. Retrying
      # aborted transactions: When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to
      # retry the whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
      # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the same session
      # as the original attempt. The original session's lock priority increases with
      # each consecutive abort, meaning that each attempt has a slightly better chance
      # of success than the previous. Note that the lock priority is preserved per
      # session (not per transaction). Lock priority is set by the first read or write
      # in the first attempt of a read-write transaction. If the application starts a
      # new session to retry the whole transaction, the transaction loses its original
      # lock priority. Moreover, the lock priority is only preserved if the
      # transaction fails with an `ABORTED` error. Under some circumstances (for
      # example, many transactions attempting to modify the same row(s)), a
      # transaction can abort many times in a short period before successfully
      # committing. Thus, it is not a good idea to cap the number of retries a
      # transaction can attempt; instead, it is better to limit the total amount of
      # time spent retrying. Idle transactions: A transaction is considered idle if it
      # has no outstanding reads or SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL
      # query within the last 10 seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud
      # Spanner so that they don't hold on to locks indefinitely. If an idle
      # transaction is aborted, the commit will fail with error `ABORTED`. If this
      # behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple SQL query in the
      # transaction (for example, `SELECT 1`) prevents the transaction from becoming
      # idle. Snapshot read-only transactions: Snapshot read-only transactions
      # provides a simpler method than locking read-write transactions for doing
      # several consistent reads. However, this type of transaction does not support
      # writes. Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
      # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that timestamp.
      # Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block concurrent read-write
      # transactions. Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
      # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read timestamp is
      # garbage collected; however, the default garbage collection policy is generous
      # enough that most applications do not need to worry about this in practice.
      # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call Commit or Rollback (and in
      # fact are not permitted to do so). To execute a snapshot transaction, the
      # client specifies a timestamp bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a
      # read timestamp. The types of timestamp bound are: - Strong (the default). -
      # Bounded staleness. - Exact staleness. If the Cloud Spanner database to be read
      # is geographically distributed, stale read-only transactions can execute more
      # quickly than strong or read-write transactions, because they are able to
      # execute far from the leader replica. Each type of timestamp bound is discussed
      # in detail below. Strong: Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all
      # transactions that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore,
      # all rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if any
      # part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
      # transaction. Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
      # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are concurrent writes.
      # If consistency across reads is required, the reads should be executed within a
      # transaction or at an exact read timestamp. Queries on change streams (see
      # below for more details) must also specify the strong read timestamp bound. See
      # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong. Exact staleness: These timestamp bounds
      # execute reads at a user-specified timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are
      # guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of the global transaction history: they
      # observe modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp less
      # than or equal to the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications
      # done by transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until all
      # conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps <= the read
      # timestamp have finished. The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute
      # Cloud Spanner commit timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
      # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a timestamp. As a
      # result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent boundedly stale
      # concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads usually return
      # fresher results. See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
      # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness. Bounded staleness: Bounded
      # staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to a
      # user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp
      # within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest
      # available replica without blocking. All rows yielded are consistent with each
      # other -- if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
      # see the transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale reads,
      # even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at different
      # timestamps and thus return inconsistent results. Boundedly stale reads execute
      # in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among all replicas
      # needed to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the
      # negotiated timestamp. As a result of the two phase execution, bounded
      # staleness reads are usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
      # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher results, and are
      # more likely to execute at the closest replica. Because the timestamp
      # negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which rows will be read, it can
      # only be used with single-use read-only transactions. See TransactionOptions.
      # ReadOnly.max_staleness and TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp. Old
      # read timestamps and garbage collection: Cloud Spanner continuously garbage
      # collects deleted and overwritten data in the background to reclaim storage
      # space. This process is known as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims
      # versions after they are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot
      # perform reads at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
      # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
      # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with too-old
      # read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. You can configure
      # and extend the `VERSION_RETENTION_PERIOD` of a database up to a period as long
      # as one week, which allows Cloud Spanner to perform reads up to one week in the
      # past. Querying change Streams: A Change Stream is a schema object that can be
      # configured to watch data changes on the entire database, a set of tables, or a
      # set of columns in a database. When a change stream is created, Spanner
      # automatically defines a corresponding SQL Table-Valued Function (TVF) that can
      # be used to query the change records in the associated change stream using the
      # ExecuteStreamingSql API. The name of the TVF for a change stream is generated
      # from the name of the change stream: READ_. All queries on change stream TVFs
      # must be executed using the ExecuteStreamingSql API with a single-use read-only
      # transaction with a strong read-only timestamp_bound. The change stream TVF
      # allows users to specify the start_timestamp and end_timestamp for the time
      # range of interest. All change records within the retention period is
      # accessible using the strong read-only timestamp_bound. All other
      # TransactionOptions are invalid for change stream queries. In addition, if
      # TransactionOptions.read_only.return_read_timestamp is set to true, a special
      # value of 2^63 - 2 will be returned in the Transaction message that describes
      # the transaction, instead of a valid read timestamp. This special value should
      # be discarded and not used for any subsequent queries. Please see https://cloud.
      # google.com/spanner/docs/change-streams for more details on how to query the
      # change stream TVFs. Partitioned DML transactions: Partitioned DML transactions
      # are used to execute DML statements with a different execution strategy that
      # provides different, and often better, scalability properties for large, table-
      # wide operations than DML in a ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements,
      # such as an OLTP workload, should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
      # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
      # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
      # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another. To reduce
      # lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks on rows that
      # match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the smaller per-
      # partition transactions hold locks for less time. That said, Partitioned DML is
      # not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used in ReadWrite transactions. -
      # The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
      # must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only a
      # single row of the table. - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows
      # of the table. Rather, the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the
      # table, in independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated
      # atomically with the base table rows. - Partitioned DML does not guarantee
      # exactly-once execution semantics against a partition. The statement is applied
      # at least once to each partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML
      # statement should be idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it
      # is potentially dangerous to run a statement such as `UPDATE table SET column =
      # column + 1` as it could be run multiple times against some rows. - The
      # partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for Commit or
      # Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing the
      # ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement executed
      # on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was never executed
      # against other rows. - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the
      # execution of a single DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql. -
      # If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
      # operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
      # value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the operation is
      # stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is possible that at this
      # point, some partitions have been committed (or even committed multiple times),
      # and other partitions have not been run at all. Given the above, Partitioned
      # DML is good fit for large, database-wide, operations that are idempotent, such
      # as deleting old rows from a very large table.

        # time spent retrying. Idle transactions: A transaction is considered idle if it
        # has no outstanding reads or SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL
        # query within the last 10 seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud
        # Spanner so that they don't hold on to locks indefinitely. If an idle
        # transaction is aborted, the commit will fail with error `ABORTED`. If this
        # behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple SQL query in the
        # transaction (for example, `SELECT 1`) prevents the transaction from becoming
        # idle. Snapshot read-only transactions: Snapshot read-only transactions
        # provides a simpler method than locking read-write transactions for doing
        # several consistent reads. However, this type of transaction does not support
        # writes. Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
        # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that timestamp.
        # Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block concurrent read-write
        # transactions. Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
        # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read timestamp is
        # garbage collected; however, the default garbage collection policy is generous
        # enough that most applications do not need to worry about this in practice.
        # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call Commit or Rollback (and in
        # fact are not permitted to do so). To execute a snapshot transaction, the
        # client specifies a timestamp bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a
        # read timestamp. The types of timestamp bound are: - Strong (the default). -
        # Bounded staleness. - Exact staleness. If the Cloud Spanner database to be read
        # is geographically distributed, stale read-only transactions can execute more
        # quickly than strong or read-write transactions, because they are able to
        # execute far from the leader replica. Each type of timestamp bound is discussed
        # in detail below. Strong: Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all
        # transactions that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore,
        # all rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if any
        # part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
        # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are concurrent writes.
        # If consistency across reads is required, the reads should be executed within a
        # transaction or at an exact read timestamp. Queries on change streams (see
        # below for more details) must also specify the strong read timestamp bound. See
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong. Exact staleness: These timestamp bounds
        # execute reads at a user-specified timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are
        # guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of the global transaction history: they
        # observe modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp less
        # than or equal to the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications
        # done by transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until all
        # conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps <= the read
        # timestamp have finished. The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute
        # Cloud Spanner commit timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a timestamp. As a
        # result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent boundedly stale
        # concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads usually return
        # fresher results. See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness. Bounded staleness: Bounded
        # staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to a
        # user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp
        # within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest
        # available replica without blocking. All rows yielded are consistent with each
        # other -- if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale reads,
        # even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at different
        # timestamps and thus return inconsistent results. Boundedly stale reads execute
        # in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among all replicas
        # needed to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the
        # negotiated timestamp. As a result of the two phase execution, bounded
        # staleness reads are usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher results, and are
        # more likely to execute at the closest replica. Because the timestamp
        # negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which rows will be read, it can
        # only be used with single-use read-only transactions. See TransactionOptions.
        # ReadOnly.max_staleness and TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp. Old
        # read timestamps and garbage collection: Cloud Spanner continuously garbage
        # collects deleted and overwritten data in the background to reclaim storage
        # space. This process is known as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims
        # versions after they are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot
        # perform reads at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
        # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
        # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with too-old
        # read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. You can configure
        # and extend the `VERSION_RETENTION_PERIOD` of a database up to a period as long
        # as one week, which allows Cloud Spanner to perform reads up to one week in the
        # past. Querying change Streams: A Change Stream is a schema object that can be
        # configured to watch data changes on the entire database, a set of tables, or a
        # set of columns in a database. When a change stream is created, Spanner
        # automatically defines a corresponding SQL Table-Valued Function (TVF) that can
        # be used to query the change records in the associated change stream using the
        # ExecuteStreamingSql API. The name of the TVF for a change stream is generated
        # from the name of the change stream: READ_. All queries on change stream TVFs
        # must be executed using the ExecuteStreamingSql API with a single-use read-only
        # transaction with a strong read-only timestamp_bound. The change stream TVF
        # allows users to specify the start_timestamp and end_timestamp for the time
        # range of interest. All change records within the retention period is
        # accessible using the strong read-only timestamp_bound. All other
        # TransactionOptions are invalid for change stream queries. In addition, if
        # TransactionOptions.read_only.return_read_timestamp is set to true, a special
        # value of 2^63 - 2 will be returned in the Transaction message that describes
        # the transaction, instead of a valid read timestamp. This special value should
        # be discarded and not used for any subsequent queries. Please see https://cloud.
        # google.com/spanner/docs/change-streams for more details on how to query the
        # change stream TVFs. Partitioned DML transactions: Partitioned DML transactions
        # are used to execute DML statements with a different execution strategy that
        # provides different, and often better, scalability properties for large, table-
        # wide operations than DML in a ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements,
        # such as an OLTP workload, should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
        # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
        # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
        # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another. To reduce
        # lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks on rows that
        # match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the smaller per-
        # partition transactions hold locks for less time. That said, Partitioned DML is
        # not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used in ReadWrite transactions. -
        # The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
        # must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only a
        # single row of the table. - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows
        # of the table. Rather, the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the
        # table, in independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated
        # atomically with the base table rows. - Partitioned DML does not guarantee
        # exactly-once execution semantics against a partition. The statement is applied
        # at least once to each partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML
        # statement should be idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it
        # is potentially dangerous to run a statement such as `UPDATE table SET column =
        # column + 1` as it could be run multiple times against some rows. - The
        # partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for Commit or
        # Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing the
        # ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement executed
        # on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was never executed
        # against other rows. - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the
        # execution of a single DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql. -
        # If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
        # operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
        # value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the operation is
        # stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is possible that at this
        # point, some partitions have been committed (or even committed multiple times),
        # and other partitions have not been run at all. Given the above, Partitioned
        # DML is good fit for large, database-wide, operations that are idempotent, such
        # as deleting old rows from a very large table.

        # Transactions: Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time (
        # note that standalone reads and queries use a transaction internally and do
        # count towards the one transaction limit). After the active transaction is
        # completed, the session can immediately be re-used for the next transaction. It
        # is not necessary to create a new session for each transaction. Transaction
        # modes: Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes: 1. Locking read-write.
        # This type of transaction is the only way to write data into Cloud Spanner.
        # These transactions rely on pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase
        # commit. Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the application
        # to retry. 2. Snapshot read-only. Snapshot read-only transactions provide
        # guaranteed consistency across several reads, but do not allow writes. Snapshot
        # read-only transactions can be configured to read at timestamps in the past, or
        # configured to perform a strong read (where Spanner will select a timestamp
        # such that the read is guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions that
        # have committed before the start of the read). Snapshot read-only transactions
        # do not need to be committed. Queries on change streams must be performed with
        # the snapshot read-only transaction mode, specifying a strong read. See
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong for more details. 3. Partitioned DML. This
        # type of transaction is used to execute a single Partitioned DML statement.
        # Partitioned DML partitions the key space and runs the DML statement over each
        # partition in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
        # independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be committed. For
        # transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions provide simpler
        # semantics and are almost always faster. In particular, read-only transactions
        # do not take locks, so they do not conflict with read-write transactions. As a
        # consequence of not taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are
        # not needed. Transactions may only read-write data in a single database. They
        # may, however, read-write data in different tables within that database.
        # Locking read-write transactions: Locking transactions may be used to
        # atomically read-modify-write data anywhere in a database. This type of
        # transaction is externally consistent. Clients should attempt to minimize the
        # amount of time a transaction is active. Faster transactions commit with higher
        # probability and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read
        # locks active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
        # transaction has not been terminated by Commit or Rollback. Long periods of
        # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a transaction's
        # locks and abort it. Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or
        # more reads or SQL statements followed by Commit. At any time before Commit,
        # the client can send a Rollback request to abort the transaction. Semantics:
        # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired are
        # still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write locks for all
        # writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any reason. If a commit
        # attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees that the transaction has
        # not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner. Unless the transaction commits,
        # Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about how long the transaction's locks were
        # held for. It is an error to use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual
        # exclusion other than between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves. Retrying
        # aborted transactions: When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to
        # retry the whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
        # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the same session
        # as the original attempt. The original session's lock priority increases with
        # each consecutive abort, meaning that each attempt has a slightly better chance
        # of success than the previous. Note that the lock priority is preserved per
        # session (not per transaction). Lock priority is set by the first read or write
        # in the first attempt of a read-write transaction. If the application starts a
        # new session to retry the whole transaction, the transaction loses its original
        # lock priority. Moreover, the lock priority is only preserved if the
        # transaction fails with an `ABORTED` error. Under some circumstances (for
        # example, many transactions attempting to modify the same row(s)), a
        # transaction can abort many times in a short period before successfully
        # committing. Thus, it is not a good idea to cap the number of retries a
        # transaction can attempt; instead, it is better to limit the total amount of
        # time spent retrying. Idle transactions: A transaction is considered idle if it
        # has no outstanding reads or SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL
        # query within the last 10 seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud
        # Spanner so that they don't hold on to locks indefinitely. If an idle
        # transaction is aborted, the commit will fail with error `ABORTED`. If this
        # behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple SQL query in the
        # transaction (for example, `SELECT 1`) prevents the transaction from becoming
        # idle. Snapshot read-only transactions: Snapshot read-only transactions
        # provides a simpler method than locking read-write transactions for doing
        # several consistent reads. However, this type of transaction does not support
        # writes. Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by

        # timestamp have finished. The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute

        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a timestamp. As a
        # result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent boundedly stale
        # concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads usually return
        # fresher results. See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and

        # staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to a
        # user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp
        # within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest
        # available replica without blocking. All rows yielded are consistent with each
        # other -- if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale reads,
        # even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at different
        # timestamps and thus return inconsistent results. Boundedly stale reads execute
        # in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among all replicas
        # needed to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the
        # negotiated timestamp. As a result of the two phase execution, bounded
        # staleness reads are usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher results, and are
