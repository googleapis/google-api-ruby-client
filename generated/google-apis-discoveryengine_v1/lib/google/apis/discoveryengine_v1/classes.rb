      # of population of values. The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and
      # gives a count of values that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the

        # if it's NaN, also add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if `
        # semantic_similarity_score` is NaN. - `0.2 * rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) +

        # of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of reciprocal rank of `

        # if it's NaN, also add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if `
        # semantic_similarity_score` is NaN. - `0.2 * rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) +

        # of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of reciprocal rank of `
