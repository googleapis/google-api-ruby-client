      # be activated across an organization, or whether a Compute Engine instance can
      # have serial port connections established. `Constraints` can be configured by
      # the organization's policy administrator to fit the needs of the organization
      # by setting a `policy` that includes `constraints` at different locations in
      # the organization's resource hierarchy. Policies are inherited down the
      # resource hierarchy from higher levels, but can also be overridden. For details
      # about the inheritance rules please read about `policies`. `Constraints` have a

      # "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100
      # chars" expression: "document.summary.size() < 100" Example (Equality): title: "
      # Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if requestor is the document
      # owner" expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email" Example (
      # Logic): title: "Public documents" description: "Determine whether the document
      # should be publicly visible" expression: "document.type != 'private' &&
      # document.type != 'internal'" Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification
      # string" description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp."
