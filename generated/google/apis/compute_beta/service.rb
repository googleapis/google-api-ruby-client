        # @param [String] project
        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # @param [String] zone
        #   Name of the zone for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.
        # @param [String] fields
        #   Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.

        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent

        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-

        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the

        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] zone
        #   The name of the zone for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # @param [String] region
        #   Name of the region scoping this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by

        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are

        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.

        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-

        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # project, such as debian-cloud or windows-cloud.
        # @param [String] project
        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token

        # @param [String] project
        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # @param [String] zone
        #   The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token

        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that

        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).

        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results

        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that

        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that

        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).

        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.
        # @param [String] fields
        #   Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.

        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # Retrieves a list of commitments contained within the specified region.
        # @param [String] project
        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] region
        #   Name of the region for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.
        # @param [String] fields
        #   Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
        # @param [String] quota_user
        #   Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any
        #   arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.

        # @param [String] region
        #   Name of the region scoping this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a

        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by

        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that

        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).

        #   Name of the region for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # @param [String] region
        #   Name of the region for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by

        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that

        # @param [String] project
        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # @param [String] region
        #   Name of the region scoping this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by

        # @param [String] project
        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] region
        #   Name of the region scoping this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by

        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that

        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token

        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.

        #   and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from
        #   accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        # Retrieves the list of Zone resources available to the specified project.
        # @param [String] project
        #   Project ID for this request.
        # @param [String] filter
        #   Sets a filter `expression` for filtering listed resources. Your `expression`
        #   must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
        #   The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field
        #   types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be
        #   either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value
        #   to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
        #   filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value
        #   is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
        #   must match the entire field.
        #   For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
        #   instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
        #   You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
        #   that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
        #   nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
        #   based on label values.
        #   To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #   parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
        #   central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that
        #   resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
        # @param [Fixnum] max_results
        #   The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number
        #   of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a
        #   nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent
        #   list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
        # @param [String] order_by
        #   Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in
        #   alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
        #   You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
        #   using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
        #   creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
        #   Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
        #   returned first.
        #   Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
        # @param [String] page_token
        #   Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by
        #   a previous list request to get the next page of results.
        # @param [String] fields
        #   Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
        # @param [String] quota_user
        #   Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any
        #   arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.
        #   Overrides userIp if both are provided.
        # @param [String] user_ip
        #   IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to
        #   enforce per-user limits.
