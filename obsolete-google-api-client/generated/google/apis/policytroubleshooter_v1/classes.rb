      # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`.
      # A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be
      # user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
      # A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined
      # role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources,
      # a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
      # allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
      # condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource,
      # or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies,
      # see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/
      # resource-policies). **JSON example:** ` "bindings": [ ` "role": "roles/
      # resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "
      # group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@
