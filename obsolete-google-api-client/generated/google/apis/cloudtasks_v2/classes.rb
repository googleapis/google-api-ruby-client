      # App Engine HTTP request. The message defines the HTTP request that is sent to
      # an App Engine app when the task is dispatched. Using AppEngineHttpRequest
      # requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/
      # docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the
      # following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` The task
      # will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same project as
      # the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.
      # google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and how
      # routing is affected by [dispatch files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/
      # docs/python/config/dispatchref). Traffic is encrypted during transport and
      # never leaves Google datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a
      # communication mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the
      # protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however,
      # will appear to have used the HTTP protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to
      # construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set at the queue-level
      # or task-level: * If app_engine_routing_override is set on the queue, this
      # value is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for
      # the task-level app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is:
      # * `url =` host `+` relative_uri Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers,
      # unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login: admin`](https://
      # cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because tasks
      # are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`
      # login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/
      # config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task attempt
      # has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response code in
      # the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's handler
      # returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response
      # before the deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the retry
      # configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system
      # error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic
      # congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike
      # other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app
      # handler does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue.

        # will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same project as
        # the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.
        # google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and how
        # routing is affected by [dispatch files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/
        # docs/python/config/dispatchref). Traffic is encrypted during transport and
        # never leaves Google datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a
        # communication mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the
        # protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however,
        # will appear to have used the HTTP protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to
        # construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set at the queue-level
        # or task-level: * If app_engine_routing_override is set on the queue, this
        # value is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for
        # the task-level app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is:
        # * `url =` host `+` relative_uri Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers,
        # unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login: admin`](https://
        # cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because tasks
        # are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`
        # login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/
        # config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task attempt
        # has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response code in
        # the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's handler
        # returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response
        # before the deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the retry
        # configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system
        # error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic
        # congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike
        # other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app
        # handler does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue.

        # the worker. For example, if the worker is stuck, it may not react to cancelled
        # requests. The default and maximum values depend on the type of request: * For

        # 15 seconds, 30 minutes]. * For App Engine tasks, 0 indicates that the request

        # instance_scaling) of the service: 10 minutes for standard apps with automatic

        # specified throttling: retry configuration, rate limits, and the queue's state.

        # temporarily reduce the queue's effective rate. User-specified settings will
