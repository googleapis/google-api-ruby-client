        # set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values`
        # and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `

        # of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose

        # allowed API activations to ``E1`, `E2``. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a

        # and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be

        # projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values):
        # `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: `allowed_values: "E1"
        # allowed_values:"E2"` `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and
        # values: `allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"` The accepted values at `
        # organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `
        # E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
        # with values: `allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"` `projects/bar` has a `
        # Policy` with values: `value: "E3" value: "E4" inherit_from_parent: true` The
        # accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `
        # projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both
        # allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: `
        # allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"` `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
        # `denied_values: "E1"` The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`
        # . The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `
        # organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: `allowed_values: "E1"
        # allowed_values:"E2"` `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: `

        # The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the
        # value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (
        # no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `
        # projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are
        # either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`,
        # all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/
        # foo` has a `Policy` with values: `allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"` `
        # projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: `all: ALLOW` The accepted values at `
        # organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`.
        # Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
        # with values: `allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"` `projects/bar` has a `
